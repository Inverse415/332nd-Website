They help provide the platoon with battlefield intelligence, ranging from objectives to droid presence. They are deployed before the platoon and their recon is vital for the ground and air forces. The main purpose is being the forward attachment that gathers vital information and support for the General Infantry. Whenever they're ahead of General Infantry they're going to be their eyes and ears.
