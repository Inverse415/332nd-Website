      <h2 class="text-center">Unit Guest Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All Guests must follow Unit rules for Discord, TeamSpeak, our Servers,
          and any other event-related regulations. These rules can be found in
          our constitution and you are required to review and follow them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Guests must join the discord and request tags before showing up on
          TeamSpeak. This allows us to track who joined when.
        </li>
        <li>
          Anyone who is in another unit must format their name to include their
          unit in our discord.
        </li>
        <li>
          Guests that are not in another unit must mention which member(s) they
          are friends with (Host Friend). Guests who are not in another unit may
          NOT play in our main ops, skirmishes, or fun ops. They can participate
          in our TeamSpeak, Minecraft Server, and other Events that are not Arma
          3 related.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the Host Friend leaves our unit, a guest can stay as a guest so
          long as they get approval from the Company Adjutant. The Guest is
          responsible for reaching out to get this approval, otherwise, their
          role will be removed after 2 weeks.
        </li>
        <li>
          All Friends of the Unit (FoU) must go through an approval process
          before getting their role that includes getting approval from the
          Company Adjutant and their Unit's Leader.
