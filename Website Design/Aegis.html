They help to support the ground forces by taking out large armored presences and large droid presence, acting as a mobile medical assistance base, and a hard-hitting group that can push ahead in situations where troopers can not push forward. They also assist Reaper by taking out anti-air guns.

They will communicate and pass information between their vehicle and the squad lead. They will also issue orders to the crewmen running with them. There is one crew lead per vehicle, 2 total on a squad.
